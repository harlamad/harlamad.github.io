        <p>Desmond T. Doss was a man that believed in Gods rules. When Desmond was young, he would fight with his brother becuase his father didn't care until one faithful day Desmond and his brother were out in the yard fighting and Desmond took a rock and smashed it against his brothers head. He almost killed his brother and when he came to his sences he promised to himself that he would not kill a human being and he would never touch a gun. Later when Desmond get older he ment Dorothy when he went to go save a boy and Dorothy was a nurse at the hospital and he took her out on dates and he soon told her he wanted to go to war to help save people, not by killing but nursing them back to life.  </p>
